            <h2>Best Practice: How to prepare for a Lash Lift and Tint and After Care</h2>
            <a href="about.html" rel="author">Isabel Lenzen</a>

            <p>So You are interested in getting a lash lift and tint, but you want to make sure they last as long 
                as possible. You also want to make sure that when we provide the service that the lashes will take
                and curl as best as possible. Great! We are happy to help you with that. Lash lift and tints should last 
                between 6 to 8 weeks, and the tint lasts for about half of that time. Depending on the thickness and length
                of your lashes, the lash lift taking should be no problem at all. So long as you follow these steps!</p>
            <p>Before Service: Before coming into your appointment you should have a clean face. This means also 
                free of any moisurizes, oils or creams. We also reccomend showering or doing anything that needs to 
                be done before your appointment because you cannot get the lashes wet for at least 24 hours after. 
                Wearing contacts to your appointment is no problem, but if you have any issues with pressure on 
                your eyes we recommend taking them out before.</p>
            <p>After Service: After your service you will have beautiful curled and dark lashes! But we want to take 
                care of them so they will last. After your service please refrain from wearing any mascara, and do not 
                get your lashes wet for at least 24 hours. After the 24 hours, feel free to do as you please. </p>
